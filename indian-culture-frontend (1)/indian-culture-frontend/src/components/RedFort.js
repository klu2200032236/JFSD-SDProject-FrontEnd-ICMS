        The Red Fort in Delhi is a symbol of Mughal architecture, known for its massive red sandstone walls and historical significance. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort has been the site of many important events in Indian history, including the first war of independence in 1857.
